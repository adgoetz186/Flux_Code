The order that the .py programs need to be run (along with a breif description is)

1. from_mat.py - loads the recon model from the specified mat file and saves it as a dictionary of pickled objects.
    The new saved model can be loaded with load_pkl_model() also updates bounds to replace inf in bounds with 1000
2. add_rxns - adds reactions which are important for model behavior (GLUN and SERtm) also sets constraints on
    biomass reactions and a few others
3. experimental_align - file which ties model to experiment, as such there might be more than one of these
    generates model which is aligned with experiment as well as a data file which contains information about the
    results such as the model and experimental alignment
4. essential_flux_dataframe - finds a dataframe for which each row gives a list of essential fluxes.
    The row contains 1s and 0s with as many entries as there are reactions in the original model.
    1 designates the reaction is essential, 0 designates the reaction is unessential.
5. minimal_model_from_dataframes - takes a folder full of dataframes and generates a minimal model from it

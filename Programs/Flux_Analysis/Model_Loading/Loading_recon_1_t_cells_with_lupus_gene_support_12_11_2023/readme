Run the files in the following order:
1. from_mat.py
2. curate_model.py (This compiles gene data after rxns are added)
3. flux_array_to_experimental_align_file.py
3. experimental_align_t_cell_initial_fit.py
4. experimental_align_t_cell_single_size.py
5. essential_flux_dataframe.py
6. consensus_model_from_dataframes.py
7. post_min_model_alterations_single_size.py
8. generate_internal_S_mat.py
The output of 8 is a matrix "S" which should be processed in matlab with the command "NS = null(S,"rational")"
The output of this should be saved as NS in the same folder.
This can be all done in python but any method which does not generate a sparse nullspace will lead to significant increases in testing for thermo feasibility
(numpy does not natively seem to be able to do this and it is prohibitively costly in sympy)

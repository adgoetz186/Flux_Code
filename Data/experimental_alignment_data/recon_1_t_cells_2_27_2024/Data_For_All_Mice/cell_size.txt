# provide arguements for a np.linspace sweep seperated by commas
# if you want to search through several sizes, specify start value, stop value, and number of values to test between
# alternatively if you want to use a single value specify it as "value, value, 1"
# sizes are assumed to be in pg (10^-12)
# T-Cells have close to 80 pg of protein (validate)
# the fraction of biomass protein is 0.706
